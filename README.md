# grupo-bimbo Kaggle competition

In this competition, Grupo Bimbo invites Kagglers to develop a model to accurately forecast inventory demand based on historical sales data. Doing so will make sure consumers of its over 100 bakery products arenâ€™t staring at empty shelves, while also reducing the amount spent on refunds to store owners with surplus product unfit for sale.

*Given code doesn't get the result, it divides the training dataset into the separate.csv files based on the product id in order to make it possible to train models on weak machines.*
